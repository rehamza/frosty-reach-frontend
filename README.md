# Frosty reach frontend
This is the frontend repository build on typescript lang , react and graphql for cold email marketing UI


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Folder structure rules
1. Folder name should be camelCase on First layes under src or app and after the 1st layer Folder names should be PascalCase
2. Use typescript arrow function with types and separate export for component building
3. tsx file extention should be PascalCase

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
